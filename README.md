Eye Gaze Trakcer is designed to accurately estimate where someone is looking.

Using a proper calibration screen, we first train the model with user's facial data.

Then, in the testing window, your eye data corresponding to various points is collected.

Thereafter, run the Results.py file. It runs 12 algorithms on the data and produces results indicating which one is the best.

Our research suggests that our in-house SAPLR (Single Axis Parametric Linear Regression) is likely to be the best in most of the cases.
